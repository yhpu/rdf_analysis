# RDF Analysis

RDF Analysis is a comprehensive tool designed to process output data from various molecular simulation software.  
It calculates the radial distribution function (RDF) to characterize molecular structures and interactions,  
and generates detailed charts and data outputs for further analysis.

## Features

- Supports multiple molecular simulation output formats  
- Calculates radial distribution functions (RDF) accurately  
- Outputs both raw data files (.dat) and corresponding figures

### Use Conda

```bash
conda create --name rdf python=3.10
conda activate rdf
```

### Use UV

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage
